<h1>Rental Policy: </h1>
<p>The company has many locations where you can rent a car. The rental locations are located in different cities throughout the country. There can be more than one company location in a city.

Anyone over 21 who has a valid driver’s license can rent a car. Customers under 25 or over 75 years pay different (higher) charges then other customers.

Before renting a car, a customer usually makes a reservation for a car. A customer specifies the dates when the car will be rented, the pick-up location, the drop-off location, and the category of car he wants to rent. A customer may specify, that he wants some extra equipment in the car, for example a GPS, a car seat for a child, etc.

When a customer rents a car, he declares the pick-up and drop-off location, and the drop-off date. The customer can buy various types of insurance. He can also decide that he doesn’t need insurance because the insurance is covered otherwise, for example by his credit card company. The customer can choose additional options such as the possibility of an early drop-off, various refueling options,.

The customer pays the charges when he returns the car.</p>
